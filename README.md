## Introduction
COVID-19, short for "Coronavirus Disease 2019," is a highly contagious and potentially severe respiratory illness caused by the novel SARS-CoV-2. It was first identified in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 and has since spread globally, leading to a pandemic. COVID-19 is primarily transmitted through respiratory droplets when an infected person coughs, sneezes, or talks. Common symptoms include fever, cough, and difficulty breathing, although it can range from mild to severe, with some cases leading to hospitalization and death. Public health measures such as vaccination, mask-wearing, social distancing, and hand hygiene have been essential in managing its spread. The COVID-19 pandemic has had far-reaching impacts on healthcare systems, economies, and daily life worldwide, prompting widespread efforts to control and mitigate its effects.

Today, I will delve into the data related to COVID-19, examining the impact of COVID-19 on the number of deaths and the impact of the vaccination from 2020 to 2023
